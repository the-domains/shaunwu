# What can I do to make sure I am becoming the best version of myself? 

Every single human in this world is born with a pre-determined structure. Each structure of this person consists of: 

* His/her extrinsic and instrinsic character traits 
* His/her possible trends in life: Career (Studies), Wealth, Health, Love,  Family and others 

To be the best version of yourself is like the best salesperson who knows his/her product best. 

1\. **Understand your personality and background**

* How/What you think in your mind
* How/What your apparent actions are
* Your existing knowledge/education
* Your family background
Your geographical location 

2\. **Discover your perception** (How you perceive each area of your life)

* What do you expect of yourself in your career 
* What type of relationship you look forward to 
* What are your plans towards wealth/asset building 

3\. Combine your perception with your possible life trends and the current society trend. 

4\. Accept who you are and what you have.

5\. Identify your best possible fit, for example:

* The best possible fit in career/studies 
* The more suitable type of partner 
* The most appropriate type of channel for wealth building 

6\. Take action.

* Leverage on what is present and strong in you
* Build and improve on what is missing or weak in you

Lastly, always be
patient
on the lookout for opportunities
prepared to brave obstacles
Do what you can and must do. When you achieve, you have already made full use of your potentials. And even if you don't, you have already done your best which many can't.
